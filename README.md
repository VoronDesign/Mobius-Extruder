This is the Mobius Extruder. It's a dual geared hobbed filament extruder designed for the Voron family of printers. It features a 4:1 belt driven design to provide torque while being able to be near silent.  It has been tested to work with most flexibles in a Bowden configuration. You must perform your own tuning to get the best results.
