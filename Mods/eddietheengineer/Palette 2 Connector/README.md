# Mobius 3.1 Mod for Palette 2 Connection

The Palette 2 has a custom filament tube that connects the Pallette to the printer's extruder. It does not have the standard 4mm OD of most bowden tubes, so it does not fit in the standard push fit Bowden connectors. The distance between the Palette, the extruder, and the hot end must remain constant so that the Palette can stay in sync with the printer, so securing the custom filament tube to the Mobius 3 is important. 

I've modified the input side of the Mobius 3.1 parts to fit the rubber grommet that the custom filament tube mates with. Make sure that filament slides freely through your printed parts--if not, use a very small drill bit to clean up the part.
